## Description

This website is designed to make the rental process as smooth and easy as possible for everyone involved.

Our website has three different roles: employee, renter, and landlord. Each role has its own set of features and capabilities.

For landlords, our website allows them to purchase properties through Zillow's API. This makes it easy for landlords to quickly and easily add new properties to their portfolio. They can also assign maintenance requests to employees through our website.

Renters, on the other hand, can use our website to view and rent properties. They can also view their rent and make maintenance requests.

Employees, who are responsible for managing the properties, can take on maintenance requests and set their status.

Overall, our rental property management website is designed to make the rental process as efficient and hassle-free as possible for everyone involved.
